# asm2464pd-soft-replug

**ASM2464PD USB4 enclosure stuck at USB 2.0 after boot — root cause and software fix.**

A USB4/USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 NVMe enclosure built on the **ASMedia ASM2464PD** bridge
enumerates at **USB 2.0 High Speed (480 Mbps, ~41 MB/s)** on every boot when it is
attached during power-on. Physically replugging the cable restores **20 Gbps
(Gen 2x2, ~1–2 GB/s)** — until the next reboot.

This repo documents the root cause and ships a **software fix**: a vendor SCSI
command that makes the bridge reboot itself and retrain the link, plus a systemd
unit that applies it automatically at boot. No cable touching, no extra hardware.

This fork is configured for an **OWC Express 1M2** (`1e91:de79`) mounted at
`/mnt/external_ssd` on an ASUS Ascent GX10.

```
[  1.5s]  usb 5-1: new high-speed USB device number 2 using xhci-hcd    ← boots degraded
[ 14.4s]  usb 5-1: USB disconnect, device number 2                      ← fix fires
[ 17.4s]  usb 6-1: new SuperSpeed Plus Gen 2x2 USB device number 2      ← 20 Gbps, hands-free
```

## TL;DR

```bash
# Software replug: CPU-reset the ASM2464PD (it re-enumerates at full speed in ~3 s)
sg_raw /dev/sgX e8 50 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
```

> **⚠️ Do NOT send `e8 51`.** That variant halts the bridge until you physically
> unplug it. `0x50` = CPU reset (self-recovering), `0x51` = halt-for-disconnect.
>
> **⚠️ Unmount the filesystem first**, and make sure `/dev/sgX` really is the
> enclosure (see [Safety](#safety)). These are undocumented vendor commands —
> use at your own risk.

## Symptom

- Boot with the enclosure attached → `lsusb -t` shows the device at `480M` under
  the USB 2.0 root hub; the SuperSpeed companion bus logs **nothing** — no
  connect attempt, no link-training error.
- Replug while the OS is running → `new SuperSpeed Plus Gen 2x2 USB device`.
- Observed on an NVIDIA DGX Spark (GB10, aarch64, kernel 6.17), but the
  mechanism is platform-generic; any host whose early-boot xHCI comes up slower
  than the bridge's SuperSpeed polling window can trigger it.

## Root cause

**It's a boot-time race, not a cable, port, or power problem.**

Attach history recovered from persistent kernel logs over six weeks:

| Attach context | Link trained | Occurrences |
|---|---|---|
| Within ~1–3 s of a boot | USB 2.0, 480M | **16 / 16** |
| Into an already-running host (replug) | Gen 2x2, 20000M | **9 / 9** |

The decisive data point: a **65-hour host power-off** produced exactly the same
480M result as a 24-second warm reboot — so cutting power without changing the
*timing* fixes nothing.

At power-on the ASM2464PD runs its link ladder (USB4 → SuperSpeed → USB 2.0)
against a host xHCI that UEFI has not finished bringing up. It burns its bounded
SuperSpeed LFPS polling retries, drops to `SS.Disabled`, enables its USB 2.0
terminations, and stays there **for the life of that attach**. A device in
`SS.Disabled` presents no SuperSpeed receiver terminations, and a host can only
*detect* terminations — nothing the host does can command them back.

### Why the usual resets can't fix it

All of these were tested and all fail, because they reset the *host* side only:

| Attempted | Result |
|---|---|
| `usbX-portY/disable` cycle (HS + SS ports) | device re-enumerates, still 480M |
| Full xHCI controller unbind/rebind (HCRST, LTSSM restart from Rx.Detect) | still 480M |
| USB-2 suspend/resume, runtime PM, `authorized`, `usbreset` ioctl | no effect on SS terminations |

Cutting VBUS in software was impossible on this host: `HCCPARAMS1` bit 3
(PPC) = 0 — port power control not implemented, `PORTSC.PP` is read-only — and
every root hub reports `wHubCharacteristic 0x000a` ("No power switching"), so
`uhubctl` is a no-op. No Type-C/UCSI/PD driver, no VBUS regulator, no BMC.

The only thing that ever worked was making the **device** restart its ladder
while the host is ready — which a physical replug does, and which the vendor
reset below does in software.

## The fix

The ASM2464PD accepts vendor SCSI commands **even over the degraded USB 2.0
link**. The ASM246x family uses `0x50`-offset subcommands (vs the older
ASM236x):

| CDB | Function |
|---|---|
| `e4 06 50 07 f0 00` | Read 6-byte firmware version (XDATA `0x07F0`, mapped via `0x500000`) — harmless probe |
| `e8 50` + 13×`00` | **CPU reset** — MCU cold-boots, re-runs the attach ladder, trains full speed in ~3 s |
| `e8 51` + 13×`00` | Halt-for-disconnect — **stays down until a physical VBUS cycle. Avoid.** |

Command-set documentation: [cyrozap/usb-to-pcie-re](https://github.com/cyrozap/usb-to-pcie-re)
(ASM2x6x notes). Reset opcode confirmed from
[tinygrad/asm2464pd-firmware](https://github.com/tinygrad/asm2464pd-firmware) `flash.py`.

## Install

```bash
sudo install -m755 usb-reset.sh /usr/local/bin/
sudo install -m644 usb-gen2x2-fix.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable usb-gen2x2-fix.service
```

At boot the unit waits for the fstab mount, checks the link and, only if degraded:
unmounts cleanly → sends the CPU reset → waits for re-enumeration → **verifies
by measured throughput, not exit code** → remounts. A healthy, mounted device
exits untouched. If the drive is absent, unmounted, or the reset fails, the unit exits
non-zero, leaves the disk unmounted, and prevents Docker from starting rather
than silently running against missing or degraded storage. Normal OS boot still
continues.

Optional: `usb-link-check.{sh,service,timer}` — an hourly/boot-time monitor
that writes a loud MOTD warning if the disk is ever found on a degraded link.

## Safety

- The script locates the enclosure **by VID:PID through sysfs** and resolves its
  `sg` node through the device path — it never guesses an `sg` number, so it
  cannot address another UAS device (a KVM's virtual-media drive, for example).
- It refuses to act if the filesystem cannot be unmounted cleanly.
- The reset does not touch flash. The dangerous opcodes in this family are the
  flash/config writes (`0xE3`, `0xE1`, `0xE5`) — this project sends none of them.
- Newer bridge firmware exists (this unit shipped `241129_85_00_00`; ASMedia has
  released up to
  [`250717_85_00_00`](https://www.station-drivers.com/index.php/en/component/remository/Drivers/Asmedia/ASM-2464-NVMe-USB-4.x-Controller-(40Gbps)/Asmedia-ASM2464-NVME-USB-4.x-Controller-Firmware-Version-250717_85_00_00/lang,en-gb/)
  on station-drivers), and since the race lives in the bridge's power-on link
  ladder a firmware change *could* address it — but ASMedia publishes no
  changelogs, **nothing confirms any release fixes this**, and flashing carries
  brick risk. If you do flash: match your unit's suffix line (`_85_00_00` for
  generic enclosures — avoid vendor-customized variants like `_85_4F_05`), and
  note the updater is Windows-only. The boot-time reset makes it unnecessary
  either way.
