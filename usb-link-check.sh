# (41 MB/s instead of ~2 GB/s) since 2026-08-08, across three reboots, silently.
# The link only trains Gen 2x2 when the device attaches AFTER Linux is up, so every
# boot with the drive attached comes up degraded. See FINDINGS.md.

  ##  USB DISK DEGRADED  ##
  $MOUNT is linked at ${speed}M (${rx}/${tx} lanes), not ${WANT_SPEED}M 2/2.
  That is ~41 MB/s instead of ~2 GB/s.

  Cause: the enclosure was attached during boot. It only trains Gen 2x2 when it
  attaches AFTER Linux is up. Run:  sudo usb-reset.sh
