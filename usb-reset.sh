# usb-reset.sh - automatically recover an ASM2464PD enclosure from its
# boot-time USB 2.0 (480M) fallback to USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 (20000M). No replug needed.

# THE FIX (proven live 2026-08-13, see FINDINGS.md):
#   Vendor SCSI command 0xE8 0x50 reboots the ASM2464PD's MCU. The bridge
#   disconnects, cold-boots its firmware, re-runs its attach ladder against the
#   now-ready host, and trains Gen 2x2 in ~3 seconds. This is a software replug.
#   Command set documented by cyrozap/usb-to-pcie-re; reset opcode confirmed via
#   tinygrad/asm2464pd-firmware (ASM246x uses 0x50-offset subcommands).
#     0xE4 (0x50-mapped XDATA read) = fw version @0x5007f0  -> read-only probe
#     0xE8 0x50 = CPU reset  -> full reboot, self-re-enumerates   <- THE FIX
#     0xE8 0x51 = halt-for-disconnect -> stays down until VBUS cycle. DO NOT USE.
#
# WHY the fallback happens: the bridge races UEFI at power-on. Attach during
# boot -> 480M (16/16 boots); attach with Linux up -> Gen2x2 (9/9). VBUS cannot
# be cut in software on this host (HCCPARAMS1 bit3 PPC=0, all 12 root hubs
# report "No power switching"), so the MCU reboot is the only software path.
#
# SAFETY: the target is located by VID:PID through sysfs, never by guessing an
# sg number. Other UAS devices can never match the OWC's 1e91:de79 identity.
#
# Install: sudo install -m755 usb-reset.sh /usr/local/bin/
